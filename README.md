# 3.3v-NRF24-Flipper-Zero-Board
These are the Gerber and BOM files used to produce the NRF board. NRF24 board is used to launch sniffing applications and mousejacking attacks on the Flipper Zero's header pins. 

This board runs on the 5v power out on the Flipper's header pins, and leaves the right side pins 9-18 open. Couldn't I have just created a board that uses the 3.3v pin to power the NRF? Yes. But I wanted something more compact. Since the NRF24 uses almost all the pins on the left, then might as well use ALL the pins.
